# Hua-Rong-Dao-Puzzle-solver-AI-Project-using-serveral-different-AI-algorithms-in-Python
Hua Rong Dao Puzzle solver project using serveral different AI algorithm including: DFS algorithm, A star algorithm and   Manhattan Distance heuristic Algorithm

This is an AI project that I implemented in Python.
I used 3 different AI alogrithm to solve this puzzle game called Hua Rong Dao.
The Three algorithm are : Depth First Search Algorithm, A Star Alorithm, and Manhattan Distance heuristic Algorithm

I completed this project in Feburary 2023

The puzzle looks like the following:
